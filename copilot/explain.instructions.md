* Give particular attention to the meaning of each atom in the body.
* Explain carefully the aggregations, mentioning the specific aggregation used, the aggregating variable and the contributors.
* Explain conditions, giving a meaning to used expressions.
* Based on the shape of the head, state if the rule is a fact (no body), a TGD rule (the head contains an atom), and EGD (the head contains an equality).
