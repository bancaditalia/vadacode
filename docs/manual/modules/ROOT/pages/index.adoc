A https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code,window=_blank] extension with support for the Datalog+/- language, offering support for https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense[IntelliSense,window=_blank], debugging, formatting, documenting, code navigation, refactoring, natural language coding, and more!

All code editing features (e.g. diagnostics and fragment detection) are implemented directly in Vadacode and don't require the reasoner.


## Quick start

-   **Step 1.** **Install** VSCode;
-   **Step 2.** In VSCode, go to View > Extensions, click on the three-dots (...) button at the top of the tab and click on the **Install from VSIX...** menu. Select the Vadacode `.vsix` file;
-   **Step 3.** If xref:walkthroughs.adoc[] don't open automatically, you can give them a look using the **Walkthrough: Open Walkthrough...** command;
-   **Step 4.** Open or create a Datalog+/- file or notebook and start coding!

## Jupyter Notebook quick start

The Vadacode extension offers support for xref:notebooks.adoc[] to provide you a great Datalog+/- notebook experience directly in VS Code.

Datalog+/- notebooks are part of the Vadacode extension, so if you have Vadacode you are good to go.

Open or create a Datalog+/- Notebook file (``.vadaynb``) and start coding in our Notebook Editor!
