# Binding actions

Datalog+/- language supports data source binding through the https://www.vadalog.org/vadalog-handbook/latest/annotations-bindings.html[`@bind`] annotation. Vadacode improves user experience with binding with a set of specific actions. 

## `@input` binding actions

When you declare an `@input` binding, you get two handy inlay buttons: **Test binding** and **Infer schema...**.

### Action: Test binding

This action allows you to test the binding by executing a stub Datalog+/- program that the binding runs without any errors. It is useful for verifying that the binding is correctly set up and that the data can be retrieved as expected; in case of errors, the action will show an error message with details about the issue, coming directly from the reasoner.

### Action: Infer schema...

With Vadacode you can even infer the schema of the data source you are binding to.

Under the hood, this action executes a stub Datalog+/- program that, thanks to a copy rule, inputs facts from the data source and outputs them for being read by Vadacode. The schema is then inferred from received data, and Vadacode enriches the `@input` binding with `@mapping` statements and the input predicate documentation using xref:vadoc.adoc[] format.

NOTE: This feature requires the external reasoner.

The user is requested for the number of rows to read from the data source to infer the schema.

CAUTION: Since the `@bind` annotation does not specify the breadth of the data to be read, the user is requested for the number of columns to infer the schema for; if the specified number of columns is greater than the actual number of columns in the data source, the inference will fail.
