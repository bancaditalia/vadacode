# References
:experimental:

Vadacode shows reference search results as separate view, just like search results. It complements the peek view presentation that is also built into VS Code.

To show references to an atom, right-click on it to open its context menu and select menu:Find All References[] (or alternately, via kbd:[Alt,Shift,F12]).

Vadacode will then show references in a dedicated tree view that sits in the sidebar.

You can navigate through search results; when an item is selected, you are brought directly to the line containing the reference.

You can even remove references from the list using the handy cross symbol.
