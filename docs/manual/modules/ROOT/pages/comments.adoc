# Comments

NOTE: Vadacode comments are by definition comments, and as such are dropped by the reasoner.

Vadacode supports two main uses for comments: <<Colored hints>> (documented here) and code documentation using xref:vadoc.adoc[Vadoc].

## Colored hints

Vadacode Scan for `BUG`, `HACK`, `FIXME`, `TODO`, `NOTE`, `COMMENT` comments within your source, and colors them in code so you can mark clearly code sections that need some attention.

To add such comments, just write the built-in keyword (e.g. `TODO`), followed by a semicolon `:`.
