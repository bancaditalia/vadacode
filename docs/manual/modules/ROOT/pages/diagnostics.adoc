# Diagnostics
:experimental:

Diagnostics are a way to indicate issues with the code.

## Errors & warnings

Vadacode constantly analyze your code in the background. Since we love bug-free code, warnings and errors show up in multiple places:

* In the Status Bar, there is a summary of all errors and warnings counts.
* If you open a file that has errors or warnings, they will be rendered <<Inline code,inline>> with the text and in the overview ruler.
* You can click on the summary or press kbd:[shift+command+M] to display the <<Problems tab>> with a list of all current errors.

NOTE: All diagnostics are documented in the xref:diagnostic-codes.adoc[] page; error reporting always include diagnostic identifiers (e.g. `1019`) which are hyperlinked to manual pages with more information about the error.

### Inline code

Diagnostics are shown inline with the usual **squiggly line** aesthetics.  As Vadacode doesn't specify custom colors, coloring follows and matches the selected xref:architecture.adoc#theming[theme].

Generally errors are shown in red, warnings in yellow, and hints in gray. You can always hover on the position marked by a squiggly line to get the full qualification of the diagnostic.

### Problems tab

Diagnostics are gathered as well in the Problems tab of Visual Studio Code, where you can find them along with relevant information (type, message, source, error code, position).

## Error Tolerant Parser

Most of the time, the code in the editor is incomplete and syntactically incorrect, but developers would still expect autocomplete and other language features to work.

Therefore, an *error tolerant parser* is necessary: the parser generates meaningful https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree[Abstract syntax tree] (AST) from partially complete code, and Vadacode provides language features based on the AST.

You can easily see the advantage of this approach if you add a parsing error in the middle of a Datalog+/- program: if the error is recoverable, Vadacode is able to resume understanding code regularly.
