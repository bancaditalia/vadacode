# Renaming symbols
:experimental:

Renaming is a common operation related to refactoring source code, and Vadacode supports the renaming of atoms and variables.

## Atoms

Vadacode supports the renaming of atoms.

TIP: Atom renaming uses symbol references. This means that if you rename an atom `a`, annotation rules like `@output("a")` or `@mapping("a")` will be affected as well.

To rename an atom:

* press kbd:[F2] or select menu:Context menu[Rename symbol];
* type the new desired name;
* press kbd:[Enter].

All instances of the atom will be renamed.

## Variables

Vadacode supports the renaming of variables.

TIP: Variable renaming uses symbol references. This means that if you rename a variable `x`, all variables in the rule will be affected, but not those in other rules (as, in Datalog, variables are rule-scoped).

To rename a variable:

* press kbd:[F2] or select menu:Context menu[Rename symbol];
* type the new desired name;
* press kbd:[Enter].

All instances of the variable will be renamed.
