# Schema inference

Datalog+/- language supports data source binding through the https://www.vadalog.org/vadalog-handbook/latest/annotations-bindings.html[`@bind`] annotation. Vadacode improves user experience with binding with schema inference, i.e. the ability to automatically infer the schema of the data source and enrich with it the binding.

Schema inference is available for CSV and https://parquet.apache.org/[Apache Parquet] input data sources.

## Infer schema from input data

Vadacode adds two contextual menus to the VSCode Explorer: when you right click on a CSV or a Parquet file, you are prompted with a **Vadacode: add to CSV/Parquet** action. Just click on it, and Vadacode will create a new binding at the current cursor position in the active Datalog+/- file. With a single click, you will get:

* the `@input` statement for a new predicate after the name of the file;
* the `@bind` annotation already configured with the relevat paths;
* the `@mapping` statements for each column in the file, with the column name and type inferred from the file;
* the documentation for the predicate, with the column names and types, in xref:vadacode-manual:ROOT:vadoc.adoc[] format.
