# Definitions
:experimental:

Developers often need to view the source code definitions for code elements they use in their code. In Vadacode, the **Go To Definition** and **Peek Definition** features let you easily view the definition of a type or member. 

## What is a definition?

Datalog+/- is a declarative language in which **rule order has no meaning** (precedence has no effect when declaring a fact or specifying a rule). Nevertheless, internally the atom metadata are memorized using the first occurrence of the atom in code (so if you use the head `a(X)` and then the head `a(Y)`, atom `a` is assumed to have a single term named `X` because it appeared as such in the first occurrence of `a` as an head).


Hence, in Vadacode, definition point for an atom is assigned:

1. If the atom appears in an **`@input` annotation**, then the definition point is that annotation;
2. If the atom appears in a rule head and has a **Vadoc documentation**, that the definition point is that of the documentation;
3. Otherwise, the definition point for the atom is assumed to be the **first time** it appears in the head of a rule.

## Go to a definition

When you use the **Go To Definition** feature on an atom, Visual Studio locates the source code for the selected atom. Visual Studio changes the current focus to highlight the relevant entry.

There are several ways you can access **Go To Definition**:

* Position the cursor inside the symbol name and use the kbd:[F12] function key
* Right-click the symbol name and select menu:Go To Definition[]
* Use the kbd:[Ctrl, Click] keyboard/mouse shortcut on the symbol name

## Peek at a definition

The **Peek Definition** feature lets you preview the definition of an atom without changing the focus from your current file in the editor. Visual Studio opens a condensed **Peek** view window for the source file in place with your current file. You can change the size of the **Peek** view window to see more of the source definition:

.Peek definition menu

.Peek view window within the current view

When you close the **Peek** view window, your current code file remains open in the editor.

There are several ways you can access **Peek Definition**:

* Position the cursor inside the symbol name and select kbd:[Alt,F12] function key
* Right-click the symbol name and select menu:Peek Definition[]
* Use the kbd:[Ctrl, Click] keyboard/mouse shortcut on the symbol name
