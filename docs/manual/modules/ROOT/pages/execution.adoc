# Execution
:experimental:

Vadacode supports the execution of Datalog+/- programs directly from the editor window. TL;DR press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+Enter] and you're set.

NOTE: This feature requires an external reasoner supporting the Vadalog dialect of Datalog+/-. Reasoner endpoint configuration is described in xref:settings.adoc#_reasoner_endpoint[Settings].

## Execute a Datalog+/- program

Open the Command Palette (kbd:[⌘+Shift+P] on macOS or kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P] on Windows/Linux) and type in **Vadacode: Evaluate program** (or use directly the shortcut kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+Enter]).

The program will be sent to the reasoner, which in turn will execute it and return results to Visual Studio Code. Vadacode then shows the results in the Reasoner view:

.Reasoner view
image::reasoner-results-view.png[]

Vadacode sends requests to the endpoint specified in the `Reasoner endpoint` xref:settings.adoc#_reasoner_endpoint[setting].

NOTE: Vadacode (by design) doesn't stop you from sending ill-formed programs to the reasoner; if the reasoner returns an execution error, it will be shown in the same Reasoner view.

IMPORTANT: When returning results, ensure that results are limited to a reasonable number of tuples. Massive outputs are not filtered in the UI and may break the extension. You can use `@post("atomName", "limit(N)").` annotation to ensure that results are properly capped.
