Undeclared atom: \{atom}.
____


=== Description
This atom is used in a rule or query but has not been declared. Declare the atom to use it, either as a fact (a rule with no head and only constants, like `person("First Name", "Last Name", 37).`) or by importing it with `@input`.

[#1012]

Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Variable '\{variable}' is dangerous and involved in a join; the program is not Warded Datalog±.
____


=== Description
This error occurs because the Datalog+/- program violates the wardedness property, which is a key safety condition in Warded Datalog±.

[#1017]
== ⚠️ _No bindings for input_ (`1017`)
Warning.

[.excerpt]
____
Input '\{atom}' has no bindings. Add @bind and @mapping rules.
____


=== Description
This `@input` atom has no bindings. You need to add `@bind` and `@mapping` rules to bind the input atom to a data source. To fix it, add a `@bind` rule to bind the input atom to a data source, and a `@mapping` rule to map the columns of the data source to the terms of the input atom. 
    
Example:

[source,datalogpm]
----
@input("atom").
@bind("atomName", "data source", "outermost container", "innermost container").
@mapping("atomName", column1positionInAtom, "column1Name", "column1Type").
@mapping("atomName", column2positionInAtom, "column2Name", "column2Type").
----


[#1018]

Hint.

[.excerpt]
____
Output '\{atom}' has no bindings, output will be sent with the response.

[#1019]
== ❌ _Variable is EGD harmful_ (`1019`)
Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Variable '\{variable}' is in a tainted position and used in join or filter operation. The program does not satisfy the EGDs harmless sufficient condition.
____


=== Description
This error arises because the program violates the _safe taintedness_ condition for Equality-Generating Dependencies (EGDs).

[#1020]
== 💡 _EGD hint_ (`1020`)
Hint.

[.excerpt]
____
Equality-generating dependency: existential variables are made equal in the reasoning process.
____


=== Description
This hint indicates that the head of the rule contains an equality-generating dependency (EGD) that can lead to existential variables being made equal during reasoning.

[#1021]
== ❌ _Empty definition_ (`1021`)
Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Definition can't be empty.
____


=== Description
The annotation requires at least one term.

=== Example
[source,datalogpm]
----
% Here the definition is empty
@input().
----

=== Fix
[source,datalogpm]
----
@input("atom").
----

[#1022]
== ❌ _Undeclared variable_ (`1022`)
Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Variable '\{variable}' is not bound. Bind it either in a positive atom or in an assignment.
____


=== Description
Variables used in conditions must be bound in a positive atom or in an assignment.

[#1023]
== ❌ _Invalid negation_ (`1023`)
Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Variable '\{variable}' does not occur in a non-negated body atom. Every variable that occurs in the head and in a body negation must have a binding in a non-negated atom.
____


=== Description
If a variable occurs in the head of a rule and is also used in a negated body atom, it must have a binding in a non-negated body atom. For example, if 'X' is in the head and 'not p(X)' is in the body, there must be another atom like 'p(X)' in the body.

=== Example
[source,datalogpm]
----
% Here X is not bound in a non-negated body atom
a(X) :- not b(X).
----

=== Fix
[source,datalogpm]
----
a(X) :- c(X), not b(X).
----

[#1024]
== ❌ _Annotation parameters_ (`1024`)
Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Expected \{expected} arguments, but got \{received}.
____


=== Description
The number of arguments in the annotation must match the expected number. For example, if the annotation is '@mapping', it should have the correct number of arguments as defined in the specification.

=== Example
[source,datalogpm]
----
% @mapping requires 4 terms
@mapping("atom", 0, "id").
----

=== Fix
[source,datalogpm]
----
@mapping("atom", 0, "id", "int").
----

[#1025]
== ⚠️ _Anonymous variable_ (`1025`)
Warning.

[.excerpt]
____
Variable \{variable} is not used in the head. You should make it anonymous (replacing it with an `_`).
____


=== Description
If a variable is not used in the head of a rule, it should be replaced with an underscore ('_') to indicate that it is anonymous. For example, instead of using 'X' in the head, use '_' if 'X' is not used.

[#1026]
== ❌ _Atom signature terms_ (`1026`)
Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Expected \{expected} terms, but got \{received}.
____


=== Description
The number of terms in the atom's signature must match the number of terms in the atom. For example, if the atom is 'p(X,Y)', then the signature must have 2 terms, not 3. If the missing variable need not to be brought to the head, you can use the anonymous variable _ to mark them.

[#1027]
== ❌ _Mapping position must be an index_ (`1027`)
Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Mapping position must be an index (0-based) (instead it's '\{position}').
____


=== Description
The mapping position must be an index (0-based) that indicates the position of the term in the atom's signature. For example, if the atom is 'p(X,Y)', then the mapping position can be 0 or 1, but not 2.

=== Example
[source,datalogpm]
----
% Here position is "pos"
@mapping("atom", "pos", "id", "int").
----

=== Fix
[source,datalogpm]
----
@mapping("atom", 0, "id", "int").
----

[#1028]
== ❌ _Non-Afrati linear join_ (`1028`)
Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Rule is not AfratiLienar: predicate '\{atom}' is intensional and appears in the body of a rule with another intensional predicate.

[#1029]
== ❌ _Existential variable in Datalog_ (`1029`)
Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Existential variable '\{variable}' is used in a Datalog rule. This is not allowed.
____


=== Description
In Datalog, existential variables are not allowed. If you need to use an existential variable, consider using other fragments instead.

[#1030]
== ❌ _Atom not in guarded rule_ (`1030`)
Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Rule is not Guarded, as there is no atom in the body including all universally quantified variables.

[.excerpt]
____
Rule is not Frontier Guarded, as there is no atom in the body including all universally quantified variables of the head.

The rule contains more than one atom in the body, which is not allowed in linear Datalog programs.

[#1033]
== ❌ _Rule is not Weakly Guarded_ (`1033`)
Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Rule is not Weakly Guarded, as there is no atom in the body including all dangerous variables.
____


=== Description
Rule is not Weakly Guarded but because it misses a weak guard atom. A weak guard is an atom that contains all the dangerous universally quantified variables.

[#1034]
== ❌ _Rule is not Weakly Frontier Guarded_ (`1034`)
Error.

[.excerpt]
____
Rule is not Weakly Frontier Guarded, as there is no atom in the body including all dangerous variables in the head.
